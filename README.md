# Visualization of Electrolysis using OpenGL

In chemistry and manufacturing, electrolysis is a technique that uses a direct electric current (DC) to drive an otherwise non-spontaneous chemical reaction. It is the passing of a direct electric current through an ionic substance that is either molten or dissolved in a suitable solvent, producing chemical reactions at the electrodes and separation of materials. Electrolysis is commercially important as a stage in the separation of elements from naturally occurring sources such as ores using an electrolytic cell. 

This project provides a visualisation of electrolysis of NaCl and information about the process in detail. The visualisation can serve as a supplement to text book learning.

This project was implemented in C using the OpenGL library.
